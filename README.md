# Script for style-checking problems

This script is a set of heuristics for problem statements, metadata, and
solutions.

TODO:

* Add installation script
* Add dependencies on problemtools
* Remove dependencies on Kattis database
    * Perhaps replace with a static list of problem names
* Put spelling dictionaries into a reasonable place or dependency
* Allow selecting which checks run
* Improve the detection of numbers within LaTeX commands
* Add checks for the number of test cases
